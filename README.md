# Chessboard-Grid
I got introduced to Grid. My first challenge is to make a Chessboard by using Grid. I set the size and number of columns and rows. Change their Bg. And I found out that when I make height and width  100vh, when I enlarge the screen each column will not be apart from the each other.
